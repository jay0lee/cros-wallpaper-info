- Memory total and unused in gb.
- Storage total and free in gb.
- Logged in user email.
- Current system IP addresses
- User login time
- last wallpaper refresh time
- [Managed devices only] Device Serial Number

Options for the extension can be set by clicking the extension icon and options.

## Admin customization
G Suite admins with Chrome Enterprise managed devices can force install the extension for their users. In order for the extension to work, you must not [set a wallpaper from the admin console](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2657289?hl=en#3_wallpaper).

1. Manually install the extension in your user profile.
1. Customize the extension options as you'd prefer.

## Known Issues
- If you use Chrome Sync and log into 2 or more devices, Chrome Sync may sync the wallpaper generated by one device onto the other device. Workaround is to go to [chrome://settings/syncSetup](chrome://settings/syncSetup), disable "Sync Everything" and then disable "Themes & Wallpapers" so that wallpaper does not sync across your devices.
- For devices with multiple monitors, the primary monitor should display the wallpaper properly but wallpaper may be stretched or cropped on secondary monitors.
- When using images for background, the web server must be CORS-enabled and allow image use. Try hosting on imgur.com.
